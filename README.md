In this assignment we were tasked with creating 3 functions. 
The program continues to ask for commands in a while loop until the command is to exit the program.
After receiving the command 'A', the main directs us to the first function which receives input values and puts the numbers into a matrix.
After receiving the command 'B', the main directs us to the second function which receives 2 values and returns true if there is a path between them, or false if there is not.
After receiving the command 'C', the main directs us to the third function which receives 2 values and returns the shortest path between them. (shortest also meaning the lowest weight). For this function we implemented the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.
The 'D' command exits the program.
